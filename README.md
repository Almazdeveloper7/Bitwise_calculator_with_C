# Bitwise_calculator_with_C

This is a simple bitwise calculator written in C.
It allows users to input two integers and perform bitwise operations:
AND, OR, or XOR.
The program validates that both input numbers are within the range 0 to 255, then displays the result in both binary and decimal formats.
